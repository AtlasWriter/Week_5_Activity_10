# Week_5_Activity_10
GCU CST150-O500
C# Programming 1


The code has eros. Write up a short summary on how you went about solving the problems. (no word count limit) Error code -> correct code

Note A and B need to be the same before and after the union. Note that a union has no duplicates

A{1,2,3} U B{2,3,4} = (1,2,3,4) no duplicated

Do not write your own code, but fix that which is given.

Assessment Description
Run the following console application with the “Activity 10 Code.” This program should produce the union of two sets, but has several errors. Use a variety of debugging techniques to locate and correct the errors.

NOTE: A set is a collection of like elements that does not contain any duplicates. The union of two sets is the set that contains all the elements in both sets. Formally:

A union B = {x : x Î A or x Î B}
read: A union B is the set of all x such that x is in A or x is in B

Example: A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {2,4,6,8}, then A union B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,8} (notice, no duplicates!)
